My name is Fabius, and I am an enthusiastic <span>14 years old programmer</span>. Since my early childhood, I have been fascinated by the world of technology, and I have always been interested in computers and how they work. <br/><br/> This passion eventually led me to programming, where I can fully express my creativity and <span>analytical skills.</span>
<br/>
In my free time, I am devoted to programming. <br/><br/> I find it incredibly exciting how just a few lines of code can solve complex problems. By experimenting with different programming languages and development environments, I have continuously improved my skills and I am always eager <span>to learn something new.</span> I enjoy finding creative solutions and developing programs that can help people.</p>
